    <td> <p>1. The Lion King</p>
  <p>Genre(s): Animation, Family film, Drama, Adventure film, Musical,
Musical Drama</p>
  <p>Review: This film had it all, it was funny, emotional, had family
drama, and above all, great animation and songs! My personal favourite character is Rafiki, the Baboon!
I still can’t forget the line he says to Simba,Past can hurt, but as I see it, you can either run
from it, or learn from it! It is so true! I loved Zazu's weirdness, and
shenzi's humour, above all, i loved Pumba's innocence and Timon's
intelligence!</p>
<p>Plot summary: This Disney animated feature follows the adventures
of the young lion Simba (Zoe Leader), the heir of his father, Mufasa
(Ernie Sabella). Simba's wicked uncle, Scar (Rowan Atkinson), plots to
usurp Mufasa's throne by luring father and son into a stampede of
wildebeests. But Simba escapes, and only Mufasa is killed. Simba
returns as an adult (Jeremy Irons) to take back his homeland from
Scar with the help of his friends Timon (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) and
Pumbaa (Cheech Marin).</p>

    <td><p>3. Monsters, Inc.</p>
<p>Genre(s): Animation, Comedy, Adventure film, Film score</p>
<p>Review: Dazzlingly clever and hugely funny, it succeeds both as a
broadening of the Monsters universe and as a film in its own right.
Monsters, Incorporated had a tough task, and it’s passed with
honours.</p>
<p>Plot summary: Monsters Incorporated is the largest scare factory in
the monster world, and James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) is one of
its top scares. Sullivan is a huge, intimidating monster with blue fur,
large purple spots and horns. His scare assistant, best friend and
roommate is Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a green, opinionated,
feisty little one-eyed monster. Visiting from the human world is Boo
(Mary Gibbs), a tiny girl who goes where no human has ever gone
before.</p>

    <td><p>4. The Incredibles</p>
<p>Genre(s): Animation, Action Film, Action/Adventure, Adventure Film</p>
<p>Review: The Pixar Studios, which cannot seem to take a wrong step,
steps right again with "The Incredibles",a superhero spoof that
alternates breakneck action with satire of suburban sitcom life. After
the "Toy Story" movies, "A Bug's Life", "Monsters, Inc." and "Finding
Nemo", here's another example of Pixar's mastery of popular
animation.</p>
<p>Plot summary: In this lauded Pixar animated film, married
superheroes Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) and Elastic girl (Holly
Hunter) are forced to assume mundane lives as Bob and Helen Parr
after all super-powered activities have been banned by the
government. While Mr. Incredible loves his wife and kids, he longs to
return to a life of adventure, and he gets a chance when summoned
to an island to battle an out-of-control robot. Soon, Mr. Incredible is
in trouble, and it's up to his family to save him.</p>

    <td><p>5. Anastasia</p>
<p>Genre(s): Musical, Animation, History, Comedy, Romance Film,
Adventure Film, Family Film, Fantasy, Drama.</p>
<p>Review: The legend of Anastasia would seem like unlikely inspiration
for an animated musical, but “Anastasia” picks and chooses cleverly,
skipping blithely past the entire Russian Revolution but lingering on
mad monks, green goblins, storms at sea, train wrecks and youthful
romance. The result is entertaining and sometimes exciting--a
promising launch for Fox's new animation studio, which has declared
war on Disney.</p>
<p>Plot summary: In 1630 New England, panic and despair envelops a
farmer, his wife and their children when youngest son Samuel
suddenly vanishes. The family blames Thomasin, the oldest daughter
who was watching the boy at the time of his disappearance. With
suspicion and paranoia mounting, twin siblings Mercy and Jonas
suspect Thomasin of witchcraft, testing the clan's faith, loyalty and
love to one another.</p></td>
