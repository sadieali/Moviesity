  <h1> Top 5 Christmas movies </h1>
  <p>1. Home Alone</p>
  <p>Genre(s): Comedy, Family film, Adventure film</p>
  <p>Review: &quot;Home Alone&quot; is a splendid movie title because it evokes all
sorts of scary nostalgia. Being left home alone, when you were a kid,
meant hearing strange noises and being afraid to look in the
basement - but it also meant doing all the things that grownups
would tell you to stop doing, if they were there.</p>
  <p>Plot summary: When bratty 8-year-old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay
Culkin) acts out the night before a family trip to Paris, his mother
(Catherine O&#39;Hara) makes him sleep in the attic. After the
McCallisters mistakenly leave for the airport without Kevin, he
awakens to an empty house and assumes his wish to have no family
has come true. But his excitement sours when he realizes that two
con men (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) plan to rob the McCallister
residence, and that he alone must protect the family home.</p>
