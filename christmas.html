  <h1> Top 5 Christmas movies </h1>

  <tr>
    <td> <p><b>1. Home Alone</b><br />
  <b>Genre(s):</b> Comedy, Family film, Adventure film<br />
  <b>Review:</b> &quot;Home Alone&quot; is a splendid movie title because it evokes all
sorts of scary nostalgia. Being left home alone, when you were a kid,
meant hearing strange noises and being afraid to look in the
basement - but it also meant doing all the things that grownups
would tell you to stop doing, if they were there.<br />
  <b>Plot summary:</b> When bratty 8-year-old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay
Culkin) acts out the night before a family trip to Paris, his mother
(Catherine O&#39;Hara) makes him sleep in the attic. After the
McCallisters mistakenly leave for the airport without Kevin, he
awakens to an empty house and assumes his wish to have no family
has come true. But his excitement sours when he realizes that two
con men (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) plan to rob the McCallister
residence, and that he alone must protect the family home.</p>

    <td><p><b>2. Miracle on 34th street</b><br />
  <b>Genre(s):</b> Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Family film<br />
  <b>Review:</b> The 1947 holiday classic Miracle on 34th Street is
  transplanted to the 1990s with few changes in this family-oriented
  remake. The screenplay by the prolific John Hughes sticks close to
  the original outline, centring on Macy's executive Dorey
  Walker (Elizabeth Perkins) and her young daughter Susan (Mara Wilson),
  neither of whom much believes in the spirit of Christmas.<br />
  <b>Plot summary:</b> In this Christmas classic, an old man going by
  the name of Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn) fills in for an intoxicated
  Santa in Macy's annual Thanksgiving Day parade. Kringle proves to be
  such a hit that he is soon appearing regularly at the chain's main store
  in midtown Manhattan. When Kringle surprises customers and employees alike
  by claiming that he really is Santa Claus, it leads to a court case to
  determine his mental health and, more importantly, his authenticity.</p>

    <td><p><b>3. The Polar Express</b><br />
<b>Genre(s):</b> Animation, Family film, Adventure Film, Fantasy, Musical<br />
<b>Review:</b> The Polar Express has wonderful messages about the importance of
believing, the value of friendship, respect for leadership and courage, and the
beauty of being kind to others. <br />
<b>Plot summary:</b> Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis ("Forrest Gump";
"Cast Away") reunite for "Polar Express," an inspiring adventure based on the
beloved children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. When a doubting young boy takes
an extraordinary train ride to the North Pole, he embarks on a journey of

    <td><p><b>4. The Grinch Stole Christmas</b><br />
  <b>Genre(s):</b> Comedy, Family film, Fantasy <br />
  <b> Review:</b> Jim Carey and the Grinch were made for each other, while Taylor
  Momsen, as Cindy Lou Who, is adorable without being sugary. The script has some
  clever lines, including a parody of the film's director (former Andy Griffith
  Show star Ron Howard) and a dig at those who say that "kids today are
  desensitized by movies and television.<br />
  <b> Plot summary:</b> Inside a snowflake exists the magical land of Whoville.
  In Whoville, live the Whos, an almost mutated sort of munchkinlike people.
  All the Whos love Christmas, yet just outside of their beloved Whoville lives
  the Grinch. The Grinch is a nasty creature that hates Christmas, and plots to
  steal it away from the Whos which he equally abhors. Yet a small child, Cindy
  Lou Who, decides to try befriending the Grinch.</p>

<p><b>5. Elf</b><br />
<b>Genre(s):</b> Comedy, Family film, Romance film, Fantasy<br />
<b>Review:</b> An uncanny gift for physical comedy helps Will Ferrell propel this
festive family movie along, even though it's barely more than a string of sketches
held together by a conventional plot.<br />
<b>Plot summary:</b> Buddy (Will Ferrell) was accidentally transported to the North
Pole as a toddler and raised to adulthood among Santa's elves. Unable to shake the
feeling that he doesn't fit in, the adult Buddy travels to New York, in full elf
uniform, in search of his real father. As it happens, this is Walter Hobbs (James Caan),
a cynical businessman. After a DNA test proves this, Walter reluctantly attempts to start
a relationship with the childlike Buddy with increasingly chaotic results. </p>
